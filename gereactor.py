class GEReactor:
    """
    A two-state Markov chain reactor.

    This class implements a two-state Markov chain, often used in models like
    the Gilbert-Elliott model for simulating bursty behavior (e.g., ON/OFF states
    in RFI systems). The state transitions are determined by a 2x2 probability
    matrix, where only the diagonal elements are used: probs[0,0] is the
    probability of staying in state 0, and probs[1,1] is the probability of
    staying in state 1. The object starts in state 0.

    Attributes:
        state (int): Current state (0 or 1).
        probs (numpy.ndarray): 2x2 transition probability matrix (only diagonal elements used).

    Methods:
        __init__(probs): Initialize with probability matrix.
        step(): Update the state based on transition probabilities.
